				Rock climbing is a broad term that's used to encapsulate the many different specific types. Sport climbing is nomrally the most popular type of climbing, which normally has two people attached to the ends of a rope. One person will climb while the other person is normally placed on the ground as an anchor. The second most popular type of rock climbing is called Bouldering. Bouldering is normally done on rock figures shorter than 20 feet. Bouldering doesn't involve any ropes, and instead uses padding on the ground in the case somebody falls off of the rock wall. Most other niche types of climbing are somewhere between these two types of rock climbing. The more noteworthy ones are either free-soloing, where a route that's normally climbed with rope is climbed with no rope, or soloing, which involves a climber climbing a route alone with rope. </p>
